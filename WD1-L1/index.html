    <h4>Chapter 1: The last Clockmaker and the frozen Clock</h4>
    <p>
      In a quiet town of <i>Odeses</i>, every<br />
      <u>clock</u>, from the smallest <u>pocket watch</u><br />
      to the giant tower bell is maintained<br />
      by a clockmaker, a master of time,<br />
      <b><span style="color: blue">Severus Vale</span></b
      >. He is the last<br />
      Clockmaker, unknown to most,<br />
      his work doesn't just keep time,<br />
      but keeps Time itself from unraveling.<br />
      One night, the townfolks wake to find<br />
      every <u>clock</u> frozen at exactly 11:07.<br />
      The clockmaker was gone, leaving behind<br />
      a strange <u>brass key</u> and a <u>paper</u>,<br />
      in an incomplete <u>clock</u>, and the note reads:<br />
      "When the twelveth hour strikes,<br />
      time will never move again."<br />
      <b><span style="color: rgb(117, 176, 16)">Albus Phil</span></b
      >,the clockmaker's apprentice<br />
      takes it upon himself to find the answers.
    </p>

    <h4>Chapter 2: Chronos and the war of The Keepers and Turners</h4>
    <p>
      While going around finding answers in <br />
      <b><span style="color: blue">Severus</span></b> workshop, he finds
      <u>books</u> and<br />
      <u>journals</u>. In those <u>books</u> and <u>journals</u><br />
      he finds the word <u>Chronos</u> an ancient<br />
      machine that is said to control the<br />
      flow of time across the world. As he<br />
      flips more he finds flashbacks revealing<br />
      the war between two secret organizations,<br />
      The Keepers and Turners. He also learns<br />
      about the Twelveth Hour-a mythical moment<br />
      outside normal time. As he digs deeper a<br />
      masked man covered in black tries to<br />
      steal the <u>brass key</u>, and claims to<br />
      be a Turner.
      <b><span style="color: rgb(110, 204, 16)">Albus</span></b> fought to
      <br />
      protect it, but then suddenly the frozen <br />
      <u>clock</u> ticks once. But he doesn't have <br />
      a time to lose.
      <b><span style="color: rgb(112, 204, 20)">Albus</span></b> managed to
      escape <br />
      with the <u>brass key</u>.
    </p>

    <h4>Chapter 3: The Twelveth Hour</h4>
    <p>
      It was said that the <u>Chronos</u> is underneath<br />
      his Master's old <i>Tower</i>. He went there and<br />
      looks for it and saw it damaged and leaking glowing<br />
      sand. As he looks he saw his Master's figure<br />
      trapped. The clock was ticking it's almost time, he<br />
      is still confuse in what to do, but then a voice came.<br />
      <b><span style="color: rgb(115, 201, 30)">Albus</span></b>
      faced where the voice came from<br />
      and saw a tall man covered in black.<br />
      "Good evening to you young lad"
      <b><span style="color: rgb(117, 215, 19)">Albus</span></b> became<br />
      serious "Oh~ introduction I forgot. I am<br />
      <b><span style="color: crimson">Lucius Voldemort</span></b
      >, a turner you see.<br />
      I would like to give you an offer.<br />
      You give me the <u>key</u> and I will give you your Master."<br />
      <b><span style="color: rgb(101, 176, 27)">Albus</span></b> refused. The
      <u>clock</u> was ticking<br />
      louder and louder. Suddenly he remembered the prophecy <br />
      written in his master's book and realizes that the<br />
      prophecy was about him dissapearing to restore the time<br />
      and save his master. Without hesitation he used the <br />
      <u>brass key</u> and entered the <u>Chronos</u>, repairing<br />
      it from within and breaking the loop, while the Turner<br />
      stood helpless because his plan was destroyed.<br />
      <b><span style="color: blue">Severus</span></b> is freed, time flows
      normally<br />
      again, but
      <b><span style="color: rgb(118, 202, 35)">Albus</span></b> vanished.<br />
      <b><span style="color: blue">Severus</span></b> still hopes that one day
      his apprentice<br />
      will return, that's why he still keeps a clock <br />
      frozen in 11:07 waiting.
